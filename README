This is the README for Gzip::Libdeflate version 0.04_03.

Gzip::Libdeflate is a "module" for the Perl computer programming language,
a library of computer code to install on a computer.  This document
contains four sections:

1. About - what the module does

2. Documentation - how to learn more about the module

3. Installation - how to install this module on a computer

4. Help - what to do if you get stuck

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ABOUT

Gzip::Libdeflate - Libdeflate compression library

This module provides an interface to libdeflate. Libdeflate is a
newly-written compression library which offers the same "deflate"
form of compression as zlib, as used in gzip, libpng and many similar
utilities. This distribution includes libdeflate within itself, so it
is not necessary to have that on your system.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DOCUMENTATION

You can read the documentation for the module online at the following
website:

    * http://metacpan.org/release/Gzip-Libdeflate

(This link goes to the latest version of the module.)

After installing the module, you can read the documentation on your
computer using

    perldoc Gzip::Libdeflate

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. INSTALLATION

This module requires Perl version 5.6.1 or later.

To install the module from CPAN, use

    cpan Gzip::Libdeflate

If you have the App::cpanminus installer, you may prefer

    cpanm Gzip::Libdeflate

To install the module from the source file, Gzip-Libdeflate-0.04_03.tar.gz,
follow this sequence of commands:

    tar xfz Gzip-Libdeflate-0.04_03.tar.gz
    cd Gzip-Libdeflate-0.04_03
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If you want to test the module before installing it, use "make test" after
"make" and before "make install".
